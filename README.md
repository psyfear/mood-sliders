## Getting Started

__Notice__
If you have installed a previous version of this repo and encounter errors when starting the server, remove your local node_modules/ directory and run __npm install__ again. This is because modules installed from GitHub rather than NPM don't update automatically.

If you haven't already, install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

Then install the latest Node
`nvm ls-remote` will show available versions
`nvm install 0.11`
`nvm use 0.11`
